by PaylWinex

This script will help you use PySide with houdini.
Main differences from default pyqt_houdini.py are:

  - opportunity to have several widgets open at the same time
  
  - automaticly apply houdini-style ui design


See hqt_example.py for details.


Install:
Just copy hqt.py to PYTHONPATH or PATH. For example:

$HFS\python27\lib\site-packages\hqt.py
